# ChatGPT-Telegram-Bot
Using simple Python code to get a functional Telegram Chat bot linked to the OpenAI API that can operate in a group.
The script has been modified so the bot can be asked questions by mgroup members directly by using the @TelegramBotUsername in Telegram.

Firstly copy the script from the "TelegramBotCode" file in the repository.

Replace the following three lines of code with your own Telegram Bot Token, OpenAI API key and @BotUsername

# Telegram Bot Token
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "ENTER BOT TOKEN HERE"

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'ENTER API KEY HERE'

# Bot Username
BOT_USERNAME = "@BOTUSERNAMEHERE"  # Replace with your bot's username
